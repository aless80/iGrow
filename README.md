# iGrow

## Looking back
This was my first project using front-end software. Looking back on it, it was very useful to learn not only HTML, but also javascript. I would now use a higher level framework to improve the UI, use SQL or even better noSQL storage, and starting working with technologies that are mobile app friendly. 

## iGrow
Follow this link to try this application: 
[edosil.net/igrow/](http://edosil.net/igrow/ "iGrow")

The application page shows a graph and some controls. 
The graph shows the average weight [Kg], length [cm] or BMI [Kg/m2] of a baby between 0 and 200 weeks of age. The data was downloaded from the World Health Organization database.

The buttons on the bottom of the page allows the user to add their desired data as follows: 

1. Add a baby: click on Edit babies. In the pop up dialog fill in the Name, Gender and Birthdate.

4. Of course there are more features to discover, which are accessible using the buttons on the user interface. Enjoy!
